A Theoretical Model: Consciousness Through Time - A Fragment-Based Theory of Reality:
=====================================================================================
Short Answer (for casual or first-time questions):
--------------------------------------------------
“It’s a theory I developed about how consciousness doesn’t flow through time — it moves between fixed fragments of time, creating the illusion of past, present, and future. It also explains things like déjà vu, rebirth, and alternate realities.”

Long Answer (for serious interest, podcasts, interviews, or thoughtful conversations):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“This paper presents a theory where time isn’t a continuous flow, but a structure made of fixed fragments — like frames in a film. Consciousness, rather than time itself, is what moves. Each moment we experience is actually a static slice of a greater pre-existing reality. Our choices don’t rewrite the future — they shift our consciousness to different threads of reality that already exist. This model explains phenomena like déjà vu as cross-fragment echoes, rebirth as re-entry into new sequences, and even time travel as a detour rather than an overwrite. The theory draws from quantum interpretations, metaphysics, and personal perception — and proposes a new way to understand reality: not as something that happens to us, but something we navigate through.”
